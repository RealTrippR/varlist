Variable syntax:
    Variables are defined as so, with the name and value seperated by a colon. 
    There can be an arbitrary number of spaces between the end of the name, seperator, and beginning of the value.
    The entire variable must only be defined on a single line.

    {name} : {value}

    A variable name should contain no spaces and only the ASCII characters 'a-z', 'A-Z', '0-9', and '_'
    A variable is considered a value of integer type if it is a integer literal, hex literal, or octal literal.
    Hex literals begin with the code '0x' and octals with '0o'. The literal codes are case sensitive.
    Hex literals may contain the values '0-9' and 'A-F'. Lower case characters in hex values are not permitted by the standard.
    A literal that begins with a hex code and does not contain valid hex values is invalid.
    Octal literals may contain the values '0-7'.
    A literal that begins with an octal code and does not contain valid octal values is invalid.

    For example:
        Int literal:
            my_int : 15
        Hex literal:
            my_hex: 0xD5
        Octal literal:
            my_octal: 0o7

    If a literal that begins with the octal or hex code contains invalid characters, it must still be treated
    as a numeric value unless it's forced to a different type.

    A variable is consider a value of floating point type if it is comprised only of digits '0-9' and a single period.
    For example:
        my_float: 3.14159

    Any value that does not meet these requirements should be treated as a string.


Variable type overrides:
    The type of variables can be overridden using type specifiers.
    Type override specifiers must come after the name of the value and before the seperator.
    There can be an arbitrary number of spaces between the end of the name, the beginning of the type '<' and between the end of the type '>' and the seperator.
    There cannot be any spaces within the value markers '<' and '>.

    {name} <type> : {value}

    There are 5 type specifiers defined by the specification:

    <str> - ASCII string value
    <i32> - 32-bit integer value
    <i64> - 64-bit integer value
    <f32> - 32-bit floating point value
    <f64> - 64-bit floating point value

    For example:
    forced_str<str> : 128


Version declaration:
    Varlist files may begin with an optional #VARLIST keyword followed by the version as an ASCII string on the same line.
    The version is the year of the Gregorian calendar followed by the month (0-12) of the release date 
    of the specification of the given varlist.

    For example:
    #VARLIST 2025.12


Handling invalid variables:
    
    To avoid parser errors, all parses must implement a function to check the validity of a
    varlist file.

Definitions:
    a 'space' is considered to be any byte in a .varlist source file with a decimal value of 9, 11, 12, or 32.
